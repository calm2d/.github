## CALM - Canvas And Lisp Magic

![calm](profile/calm.png)

A Lisp image pre-bundled with [SDL](https://libsdl.org/) and [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/).

With CALM, you have:

- a cross-platform access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware
- a 2D graphics library for you to draw anything to your screen

you can:

- build a game
- generate an art painting
- make an cross-platform application
- ...

without making your user to:

- install dependencies (via the scary black terminals)
- install Lisp implemetations
- say that your are just bluffing
