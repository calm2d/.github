## CALM - Canvas And Lisp Magic

![calm](profile/calm.png)

A Lisp image pre-bundled with [SDL](https://libsdl.org) and [Cairo](https://cairographics.org).

With CALM, you have:

- a cross-platform access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware
- a 2D graphics library for you to draw anything to your screen
- a Lisp code running environment

you can:

- build a game
- generate a 2D canvas art
- make a cross-platform application
- write once, run anywhere (LOL)
- ...

and prevent non-wizard users to:

- install dependencies via the scary black terminals
- install Lisp implemetations
- read a long manual to get your Lisp based software working
