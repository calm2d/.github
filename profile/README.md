## CALM - Canvas And Lisp Magic

![calm](profile/calm.png)

CALM is a Lisp image bundled with a 2D graphics library. Currently supported operating systems include the [latest](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/) Linux, macOS, and Windows.



CALM is designed to provide a convenient way to distribute 2D graphic applications on all platforms while taking advantage of the magic of Lisp language.



The [releases](https://github.com/calm2d/calm/releases) are distributed as a compressed archive file, and the cardinal source code can be modified without rebuilding the system.



CALM is [free software](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html) and is available to be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the [Mozilla Public License (MPL)](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).
